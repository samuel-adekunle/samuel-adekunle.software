Hi there, and welcome to the inaugural post of my blog. I've had this domain name for a while and haven't done much with it, but I have decided to start a blog discussing different technology topics.

I have been coding for about two years now so I wouldn't call myself an expert, but I do have relevant experience and would like to use this blog to share my thoughts and experience with breaking into a software development career. For more about me, [click here](/about).

The first three posts will get started guide for programming to give a definitive guide on how to get started with programming. In this initial post, I will try my best to provide reasons to code.

## Five reasons to learn to code

### 1. To develop problem-solving and logical thinking skills

### 2. To improve communication and collaboration skills

### 3. For greater career prospects

### 4. To improve self-esteem and self-confidence

### 5. It's a fun and useful skill to have

## Final thoughts

In this post, I have highlighted why anyone might begin to consider learning how to code and not necessarily a career in software development. Everyone can learn how to code and should, but not everyone should pursue it as a career. Another example of this is that everyone should learn math, but not everyone should become a mathematician. In a [future post](/get-started-with-programming/3), I will be discussing how to know whether or not software development is a suitable career for you.

Next week in the [second instalment of this series](/get-started-with-programming/2), I will be discussing programming languages, revealing what I wished I knew when I started programming and how to avoid common beginner mistakes. Stay tuned!
